but never have i seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance a lot of the reviews i have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges samsung or whoever the samsung dealer on here is has only added to the confusion unfortunately br br first a few points to set the record straight the appliance is not covered in stainless steel there may be a bit of it in the trim but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn t actually sen one in person most of the outside has a black textured metal finish which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances it may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though br br there is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction which is limited to the trim 34 open button 34 and part of the door latch i have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance in fact the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet br br another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode which is not true the rack can be used in the combination grill microwave mode just fine and your microwave will not burst into flames from the manual page 11 34 grill rack to be placed on the turntable the metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking 34 it will even 34 work 34 in the microwave only setting although it won t contribute to the cooking process at all in fact the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave and grill at the same time and you can t utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place br br this brings me to the main point of my review those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave this is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison is it heavier than most stand alone microwaves of course it is because it has an entirely separate heating element electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior this is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta pizza crusts etc the additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand alone microwaves which is entirely understandable to me this also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy duty microwaves if used with the grill though it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating br br adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand alone microwaves on the market the reason for this is pretty simple to keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance without the heavy duty which is necessarily heavy inside and outside finishes the device has it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned for those who wonder why it doesn t have more capacity or more wattage the reasons all boil down to safety you can only add so much shielding to keep the size and cost of such an appliance practical i think that samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does br br in regards to cost i have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks at one point i believe it was 179 shipping included then it went up to 230 shipping not included today it is down to 199 99 with free shipping i have no idea what the msrp of the unit actually is but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries it seems

the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen ever it reminds me a lot of my samsung galaxy s4 cellphone actually all in all i couldn t be happier with my purchase and i would recommend it to anyone if

drop down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",4,5,5,Y,N,a multi function unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect the preheat setting is problematic to say the least ,i picked this unit up primarily for the convection oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility that said the unit is not without issues br br the short story is the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit the grill function is great provided you use the pan that comes with the unit the convection function is wonderful but never and i mean never use parchment paper in the unit fire the preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting the unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built the two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made br br now for those who are interested the long story br br microwave br br works just great seemed to have more power than my built in unit so i did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit the kids and i have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit br br grill br br love this feature i made the following grilled cheese upper rack and pan 7 minutes with flip at half way point turned out beautifully open face bagel with cheese upper rack and pan 5 minutes grilled to perfection br br convection oven br br i had pretty good but not perfect results here baked russet potatoes medium were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting sweet potato fries were kind of a disappointment as well they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven chicken breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but i did note that ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result french bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper the paper caught fire i checked the manual about using parchment paper i use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking and there was no warning about using it but i can tell you it is a big no no br br preheat function br br well this function is pretty worthless on my unit i have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks i have had the unit the first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up the next time we used it it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down it completely turns off including the time display and will not work at all the next time i let it cycle through both the preheat and 10 minute cycle the unit remained functional and i was able to convection bake afterwards then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook the unit shut down again as i said we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the

the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs regular oven on this unit and you should be fine for the price the unit seems a solid investment my only reservation being the preheat function which i think i will just chose to not use going forward br br recommended with above reservations ,2015-01-16,2015,1,16,1.0,4384,a multi function unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect the preheat setting is problematic to say the least  i picked this unit up primarily for the convection oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility that said the unit is not without issues br br the short story is the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit the grill function is great provided you use the pan that comes with the unit the convection function is wonderful but never and i mean never use parchment paper in the unit fire the preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting the unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built the two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made br br now for those who are interested the long story br br microwave br br works just great seemed to have more power than my built in unit so i did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit the kids and i have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit br br grill br br love this feature i made the following grilled cheese upper rack and pan 7 minutes with flip at half way point turned out beautifully open face bagel with cheese upper rack and pan 5 minutes grilled to perfection br br convection oven br br i had pretty good but not perfect results here baked russet potatoes medium were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting sweet potato fries were kind of a disappointment as well they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven chicken breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but i did note that ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result french bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper the paper caught fire i checked the manual about using parchment paper i use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking and there was no warning about using it but i can tell you it is a big no no br br preheat function br br well this function is pretty worthless on my unit i have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks i have had the unit the first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up the next time we used it it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down it completely turns off including the time display and will not work at all the next time i let it cycle through both the preheat and 10 minute cycle the unit remained functional and i was able to convection bake afterwards then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook the unit shut down again as i said we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey sometimes the unit remains functional sometimes it shuts down the hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use br br slim fry br br we have not tried this function yet but i will update

on the shows so if you ask me how exactly is a chef supposed to get the most out of this samsung i have to answer honestly i have no clue not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap i suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions and kept notes along the way you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven but as it is i think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave

don t do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch like cooking a roast or casserole i ve cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues note my review refers to an earlier model of this machine which seems identical to this one that has replaced it br br 1 form factor because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber this has the smallest possible footprint and because of the rounded back i have it tucked into a corner of the countertop this means i lose only 1 of countertop and furthermore it s an awkward part of the countertop i wouldn t use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge every other microwave i ve ever owned took up 2 of prime useable countertop this makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that i d give it five stars for this reason alone br br the interior size of this machine is bigger than you d think because it s round and all the space is useable the round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior an advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks i ve occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible and it wasn t a problem br br 2 controls i love love love the simplicity of the controls it does exactly everything i need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple i should mention i own an emerson microwave in my office that i have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate and i m of at least normal intelligence the hated emerson has lots of buttons and i m sure it does a lot of things i don t need but none of that matters because i m not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree this whirlpool however is amazing it has power defrost reheat and popcorn buttons as well as a plus and minus and a start and a stop i accomplish everything with the plus minus start and stop and occasionally power br br to operate you can just press the plus until you reach the time you want then press start bam you can t get any easier than that the time increments get larger as you increase time and this is absolutely not a problem it uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes then 15 second increments to 3 minutes then 30 second increments up to six minutes then one minute increments from there this is fine i ve never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6 5 minutes caused a meal to fail my pot pies call for 6 5 minutes at 50 power and they re fine at either 6 or 7 when i make popcorn i always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows that s because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave this is true of every microwave similarly when i m thawing something i pay attention to the progress of it because again the fat content of the food and how hard it s frozen makes all the difference in timing i suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use but that kind of ultra high end microwave isn t what i want or need br br i ve been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem i can t speak to specific reliability of the model here but mine is the same in layout of controls form factor etc

the microwave oven owner s instructions cooking guide under the slim fry entry there is apparently no app with this information available either neither is there a formula for figuring out how to slim fry additional foods other than those listed in the microwave oven owner s instructions cooking guide this problem persists throughout the microwave oven owner s instructions cooking guide in that

only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook pre breaded fried okra i was answered you can use the slim fry option 2 for pre breaded frozen fried okra i asked how and where did you find that information he replied i have gathered the information from our internal database i stated i don t exactly have access to your internal database now do i so no additional cooking info publicly available i guess if i want to try to slim fry frozen cheese sticks i ll need to contact customer service and ask which setting to use because apparently in the world of frozen food pre breaded frozen fried okra is equal to that of frozen prawns shrimp breaded that s the example food for slim fry option 2 as per the microwave oven owner s instructions cooking guide br br i asked if there were sheet pans cookware or bakeware available to be purchased from samsung or elsewhere that were known to fit in the unit specifically sheet pans standard size 1 4 quarter sheet pans won t fit because the 9 5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself no standard 9 5 x 13 sheet pan is 9 5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that i am aware of so where would i get pans that fit apparently customer service nor parts has a clue who makes the inside of an appliance capable of being a convection oven too small for standard size bakeware toaster ovens don t count but they do at least have after market sheet pans available out there that fit in them if i d wanted to make cookies on pans that small i d have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time not a convection microwave oven it should also be noted the microwave oven owner s instructions cooking guide makes a big deal out of you choosing the proper cookware this is covered from pg 22 to pg 25 br br i was told by customer service initially that what i was looking for was available and to contact parts about those last two questions i did i checked online and i called the girl who answered actually hung up on me after i insisted that customer service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available after she ended our conversation abruptly i brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the customer service rep i was chatting with br br other than the above the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well the drop down oven style door is a really nice feature the blue display lighting is pretty br br how does a company make a product without giving the consumer or providing to the consumer at an additional charge adequate instruction or equipment to use their product i just don t understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them obviously people like me don t test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product br br obviously my logic is lost on samsung or it s too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out in any case with a hefty 249 on sale to 399 full retail price tag the mc11h6033 1 1 cu ft counter top convection microwave with slim fry is definitely not worth the money since you can t use it to it s full potential br br review update br so as of christmas day i still hadn t found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit my mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven br br i was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time i d only used the slim fry feature to that point to cook a dish for christmas dinner all of a sudden it just stopped working the unit head cut off and there was no display visible i thought maybe i d tripped the breaker i unplugged the unit and checked i had not tripped the breaker but i turned it off and back on just to be sure i plug the unit back in and nothing i ve been found something else to plug into that outlet so that i can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly it was i then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section it recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in i unplugged it and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes i plugged it back in and still nothing br br for a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time definitely says nothing good about the unit for the unit to conk out while making christmas dinner that was just a headache i didn t need that day i would dub this a completely unreliable unit br br i regret that i never did have the chance to try french fries using the slim

choosing the proper cookware this is covered from pg 22 to pg 25 br br i was told by customer service initially that what i was looking for was available and to contact parts about those last two questions i did i checked online and i called the girl who answered actually hung up on me after i insisted that customer service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available after she ended our conversation abruptly i brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the customer service rep i was chatting with br br other than the above the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well the drop down oven style door is a really nice feature the blue display lighting is pretty br br how does a company make a product without giving the consumer or providing to the consumer at an additional charge adequate instruction or equipment to use their product i just don t understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them obviously people like me don t test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product br br obviously my logic is lost on samsung or it s too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out in any case with a hefty 249 on sale to 399 full retail price tag the mc11h6033 1 1 cu ft counter top convection microwave with slim fry is definitely not worth the money since you can t use it to it s full potential br br review update br so as of christmas day i still hadn t found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit my mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven br br i was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time i d only used the slim fry feature to that point to cook a dish for christmas dinner all of a sudden it just stopped working the unit head cut off and there was no display visible i thought maybe i d tripped the breaker i unplugged the unit and checked i had not tripped the breaker but i turned it off and back on just to be sure i plug the unit back in and nothing i ve been found something else to plug into that outlet so that i can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly it was i then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section it recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in i unplugged it and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes i plugged it back in and still nothing br br for a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time definitely says nothing good about the unit for the unit to conk out while making christmas dinner that was just a headache i didn t need that day i would dub this a completely unreliable unit br br i regret that i never did have the chance to try french fries using the slim fry option ,0.995

timer ,i wanted to replace our ge spacemaker over the range 30 microwave and found this model that matched well we actually have the black version but it is otherwise identical the samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the ge with a redesigned front panel i knew and trusted the samsung brand from our personal electronics such as several smartphones so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer unfortunately what i got was a bare bones minimal redesign with major flaws it s like they took the basic ge design made it super cheap and replaced the panel with a terrible non intuitive redesign br br installation was easy i was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the samsung was indeed a twin of the ge series this microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side i had to drill new holes through the cabinet above however as the top was slightly different the height is 16 for the main cabinet 16 5 8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath not shown in the picture but it s there i plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn t the same quality as the ge was br br the first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel the buttons are hard to interpret and things that are easy on the ge are now impossible or very confusing heating a beverage is common right no beverage button on this unit you need to discover the button to press is cook and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next br br what about canned vegetables there s a veggies button so this should be easy not so press the button and across scrolls select pause 1 for pause fresh pause again veggies um i know it s vegetables i just pressed the button 2 for yet another pause frozen darn guess it must be 3 veggies clear select oh no where can frozen veggies be etc at least the select doesn t scroll when it appears only when it s scrolling away but the worst part is seeing the veggies on the display alone as i wait knowing full well i pressed the veggies button br br and i still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light making it worse is that there is one button for the light hi lo off and 2 buttons for the fan on off and 4 speed actually there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use sure there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which but those are only visible up close in bright light br br gone are the easy 1 button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds i could go on and on about the poor interface but i think you get the idea br br next major issue the stovetop light is way dimmer than the ge was even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs and my ge had 2 halogen bulbs this one has a single incandescent bulb not bright at all this is huge as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit br br and a another biggie when the timer finishes it gives 4 short quiet beeps and stops no repeat nothing more so unless you are right by it it is pretty much worthless we can now only use our oven timer so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things i can t even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer br br the look is also unattractive the lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is even the display is an ugly old fashioned blue 14 segment per digit 7 digit display most calculators have better actually i kind of like the blue everything else in my kitchen is amber so it creates a nice contrast br br furthermore it is noisy it frequently makes weird grinding like noises from the bottom right i think it is a fan or the microwave element if i tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while br br finally the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn t happened again in the many months since br br is there anything i like about this microwave well it works it has a turntable it has sensor cooking and it has dual grease filters

than the ge was even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs and my ge had 2 halogen bulbs this one has a single incandescent bulb not bright at all this is huge as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit br br and a another biggie when the timer finishes it gives 4 short quiet beeps and stops no repeat nothing more so unless you are right by it it is pretty much worthless we can now only use our oven timer so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things i can t even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer br br the look is also unattractive the lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is even the display is an ugly old fashioned blue 14 segment per digit 7 digit display most calculators have better actually i kind of like the blue everything else in my kitchen is amber so it creates a nice contrast br br furthermore it is noisy it frequently makes weird grinding like noises from the bottom right i think it is a fan or the microwave element if i tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while br br finally the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn t happened again in the many months since br br is there anything i like about this microwave well it works it has a turntable it has sensor cooking and it has dual grease filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan that has 4 levels when not using the microwave 2 when in use it also has an easy to clean all white interior and it was less expensive on sale than the similar ge units but rightly so br

really given that feature much thought before making the purchase it looks nice and all but the handle gets untouchably hot if you re cooking on the stove i don t think i d ever buy another with a

automatically turns on it s a smart feature to prevent it from overheating but again the fan is super loud and you can t manually turn it off once it kicks on the bad oh my god the freakin beeps when it s done cooking are insane i ve never ever had a microwave that didn t stop beeping upon the door being opened not only does this continue but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5 6 seconds

spacemakers for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute place it in the microwave and press 34 1 34 that s all br 62 well built albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old spacemaker ii br 62 quieter than my old spacemaker ii although that s no big deal br 62 the turntable is a nice addition my old spacemaker ii did not have a turntable but reduces the total space available unless you turn the turntable off br 62 has all of the controls and options of my old spacemaker ii br plus popcorn 34 beverage 34 34 reheat 34 34 chicken fish 34 34 potato 34 and 34 vegetable 34 buttons which i probably won t use because i like to know what the microwave is doing br other new buttons are 34 delay start 34 34 reminder 34 34 turntable on off 34 and 34 add 30 sec 34 the 34 add 30 sec 34 works on its own you can press it and get just 30 seconds or add 30 seconds to any time 30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee or heating some pastries br there is a child lockout but without a dedicated button br br undercounter installation br 62 the microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases br 62 the microwave hangs from four 1 1 4 34 long machine screws which are inserted from above from inside the cabinet above if the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1 2 34 thick then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1 2 34 br 62 hypothetically you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store and 4 big washers e g 2 34 in diameter however the installation kit is probably easier br 62 if you use the template double check the logic and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly br the key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet you usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet that is the front holes should be approximately 3 1 4 34 back from the front of the closed doors br the door of the microwave needs an extra 1 8 34 on the left in order to open fully and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave if there is an obstruction on the left side such as wall cabinet or refrigerator you may wish to shift the holes 1 4 34 to the right if you can br br undercounter installation kit br 62 if this is an new undercounter installation or the space between the front and back screw holes inside the cabinet above the microwave is not 6 1 4 34 then you need ge part wx4 a019 asin b001h815to ge part number wx4 a019 under cab mt if you are replacing a spacemaker with a distance of 6 1 4 34 between the front and back holes then you probably do not need an installation kit br br if you are replacing an old spacemaker ii for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is 7 3 4 34 br 62 i purchased this profile spacemaker to replace a 23 year old spacemaker ii but neither the holes backing plate nor the screws were the same br 62 the spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker br 62 the lateral spacing side to side between the screw holes is the same 19 15 32 34 for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker br 62 but the spacing between the front and rear holes is not the same the new spacing is 6 1 4 34 br 62 so if the holes in your cabinet are for the old spacemaker ii then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this profile spacemaker draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes measure 6 1 4 34 back from the center of the front hole and drill the new hole there br 62 the screws seem to be very similar but a slightly different diameter or pitch perhaps they are metric hypothetically you could drill new holes in the old backing plate or use washers instead of the backing plate and find screws the right size and length but i decided to purchase the new kit instead br br before you replace a dead microwave oven br 62 my old spacemaker ii died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges lightning i accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset i ve had the same experience with several other appliances br 62 even refrigerators and clothes driers have built in computers these days if any electric appliance is not working properly unplug it and leave it unplugged a while for some reason perhaps large capacitors in the circuit big appliances usually need hours to reset br br reliability br if my experience with my old spacemaker ii is any indication this profile spacemaker should be very reliable although resurrected 3 times over 23 years my old spacemaker was still working when i 34 took it out of service 34 after 23 years of daily use some of the white finish was turning yellow there were patches of rust inside and the door switch which turns the light on and off was erratic br br if your old spacemaker had a tray instead of a turntable keep the tray from your old microwave br 62 the tray will fit in your new profile spacemaker the tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt on spills which may promote rust in the future br 62 i use the glass tray when i m using a large rectangular casserole or many small containers i often warm two 12 34 diameter full plates of food i use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap br 62 if you use the tray lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive then place the glass tray in the bottom br br general hints on microwave cooking br it is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking so the key to cooking many items especially vegies is to generate and hold that steam br 62 if you are warming bread wrap it in a towel it is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be if the bread is rock hard slightly dampen the towel and use half power the warm bread will be soft and fresh heat only briefly and or at reduced power br 62 you can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn on the cob in a microwave if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel br 62 rinse vegetables before you cook them that washes off any pesticides etc and the extra water will produce extra steam if the vegies are dehydrated after long storage you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re hydrate them br 62 it is usually best not to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave because the excess formation of steam lowers the cooking temperature your goal should be to create a little steam contain it and superheat it this is the same principle as a pressure cooker br 62 stir some oil e g olive oil with cut vegetables a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces

the door and pull and it feels solid when you shut it br 8 the reminder tone shuts off yes it reminds you when you forget to pull something out but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the

light goes on when you open the door some small microwaves only light up while you re cooking br 6 you can use the timer and cook simultaneously pretty standard but some don t also you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting or no need to stop and reset and you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want br 7 no door release button you just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull and it feels solid when you shut it br 8 the reminder tone shuts off yes it reminds you when you forget to pull something out but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock i swear my old microwave displayed end most of the time br 9 limited features the only special features are defrost reheat popcorn and power level 100 75 50 25 and the power saving 0 i ve never used anything more br 10 i m running out of ideas but to make a nice round 10 i ll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window this gives it a kind of window box look that i like a lot br hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave you won t regret it br note the display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you re unpacking i didn t see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked further investigation revealed the protective film which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath ,0.995

happy about this br br 2 the venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall the hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days this seems very irregular as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall not an exterior wall and the ductwork goes up through the roof not to the nearest exterior wall i really don t think it should do this the

purchased mine online from walmart but i order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you i ve had mine almost 2 months now it has a 3 prong grounding plug it s 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave so i m still getting use to that i m going to try and address everything i see people asking questions about first off when you hit a number for example 2 it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes you can press the start button and add 30 seconds if you want a specific time for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds you can press the power button then the numbers 3 4 and 5 it will start cooking 3 min 45 secs it has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn pizza dinner plate defrost etc it has a normal hum when running it has a turntable the clock is displayed in green it beeps 5 times not super loud but loud enough then stops the light comes on when you open the door and while cooking it has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door i ve not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior the handle pulls easily it has a nice weight to it i have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it so i don t know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not mine doesn t the inside dimensions are 12 in wide 12 in deep and 8 in high the turntable plate is 10 1 2 in plenty of room for most things you microwave for the outside dimensions the width side to side is 19 in the height is 11 1 2 in the outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle the actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back here s the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it i have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in from the wall i have it sitting 1 1 2 in from the back of the cabinet the actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet there are vents in the back and on the side opposite the handle left side if you re facing the microwave plus the protrusion so it needs some space this means i have it 2 1 2 in total from the wall it comes out 15 in from the back of my cabinet the front legs sit back 2 1 2 in which means that it is 12 1 2 in from the back of my cabinet to the front legs so if your shelf is 12 1 2 in deep the legs would all fit on the

good one waiting for parts,what i like about the whirlpool kitchen aid microwaves is they offer models with accuwave cooking when you cook at 50 power it cooks at 50 power rather than cycling on and off at 100 power for 50 of the time this makes a massive difference on how things cook we previously had a gh5184xps with accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking it was starting to not look so nice from normal use so i decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one after the new microwave was installed i tried a cup of water in it when i started it it sounded like an arc welder and when i looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is it looked like an arc torch flame i quickly turned it off so it wouldn t burn the place down they took it back and gave me another the very night we got it we were making popcorn in the special microwave popcorn bowl which we had used for years with our other microwaves within a minute we got an f7 call for service code they offered to exchange it for a new one but didn t have another but told me they could sell me the new 5184 and updated model of our old one i noticed that the new one had a broiler slightly different menus 50 cheaper and we had good luck with our previous 5184 however after it was installed the cook said this doesn t cook right i checked it out the updated 5184 no longer has accuwave that isn t how it was represented so i gave them their 50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory that went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time the magnetron noise would stop the fan speed up the light got brighter and the food stopped cooking since the chicken was still pink i added 2 minutes at full power and immediately received an f7 code the problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation you don t get the f7 until you try to start it again and the magnetron doesn t start we couldn t trust it with chicken we avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the f7 codes as time progressed we could do less and less now you can t even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal that was enough for me there is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory so there is no point in getting another new one thus i decided i would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that will work the dealer recommended warranty repair source wouldn t take the job when he learned which model it was whirlpool got another company to come the following morning they put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it and could find nothing wrong they said their manual doesn t even list an f7 code there is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water i went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about f7 for this microwave model with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot then i put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an f7 included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board the on site techs did not follow the checklist and called the factory the factory told them they will send them a switch to try i was hoping it would be the thermal switch but the techs indicated it was not the on site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid cycle the factory came back with as it gets hotter the switch contacts may be increasing resistance causing the problem i could repeat the f7 at will they did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the f7 error next wednesday the switch is scheduled to be delivered and the techs will be returning to put it in the service company also had little confidence in the

the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave i had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage but was certain i would not find a suitable microwave to fit since we were not replacing cabinets i had to work with the available spaces br br to my surprise the ge profile spacemaker ii was the exact size of the nook although there were many negative reviews of the product i decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at best buy through an abundance of caution i also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if i experience any of the problems others have encountered i will be able to have the spacemaker ii repaired or replaced as the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost i felt it was worth the expenditure br br so far i am very pleased with the ge profile spacemaker ii microwave my spouse and i do not cook meals in our microwave but do reheat beverages cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers and occasionally defrost meat the spacemaker performs these functions admirably although it takes about 30 more time to heat cook things than my 1100 watt microwave this has not been a problem further i like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do the control panel buttons are very responsive i have cracked other microwave s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch i do not foresee this occuring with the spacemaker ii br br in the past i have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave i found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave and the temperature remains consistent the spacemaker s interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread br br because i keep this microwave on my counter i keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron br br further i would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons the ge profile spacemaker ii has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose thus it might not be the best choice for individuals br br for me the ge profile spacemaker ii is the ideal microwave and i am giving it a five star rating if things change i will update my review accordingly s button surfaces

amazon does not tell you until after your purchase that they subcontract out delivery to a third party who prohibits you from speaking with the driver via his cellphone and thinks nothing of dropping the ball re customer communication i wasted an entire day waiting for a delivery man who did not ring my bell as instructed and had instead delivered it to my super which no one bothered to tell me the delivery was an extremely frustrating fiasco amazon needs to take more responsibility vis a vis decent delivery services next point of disappointment i paid two men to install this monster it s practically 80 lbs and impossible to install solo so they get it in and fitting properly into the drop in shelf designed to hold it then comes another surprise every time i turn it on it makes a tremendous rattley racket not unlike a jet turbine nothing at all like the smooth quiet operation of its predecessor this noise is so loud you can t even think about listening to npr or a fellow kitchen occupant during the oven s operation if i press firmly on the door of the microwave while it s on the noise mutes but who can stand in front of the microwave pressing on it every time you zap a potato i m not sure if the ace delivery company rattled something loose inside this particular appliance or if this series model contains a design flaw but the noise is really horrible there s more i was very impressed with the ease of baking in this oven the programming is simple enough for a liberal arts major to grasp quite easily but every time i use the convection function closely following all the instructions re appropriate containers elevating the foodstuffs off the rotating plate etc the oven gives off a menacing odor exactly like you sniff in a terrible electrical fire there is

fit my shelf space but if i could have i would have previewed this model at a local retailer and seen how it worked there before springing for such an expensive lemon because this behemouth is such a
